# fix scaling issue after model creation and training

# add blurb on model page that talks about what inputs it expects and how to use and interact, maybe tooltips, talk about input in mg / the chinese standard idk hwo to implement that

# double check and make sure model is trained well and giving good outputs everytime

# add / edit comments on all 

# do readme/ project overview page

# export app.py, main.ipynb, and tea_catechins.ipynb to Complete Project PDF

# Record Video

# Edit Video and render

# Upload documents to google drive

# Turn in (check all turn in locations, I think I also have to send an email)

Project Overview and Data Acquisition, Analysis, and Preparation
Comprehensive project. Data acquired from a relevant source, thoroughly analyzed and prepared effectively for modeling. All actions are well justified.
Adequate project overview with data acquired, analyzed, and prepared effectively, but with minor issues or gaps in rationale.
Brief project overview with data acquired and partially analyzed or prepared, with notable issues. Justifications for some actions are missing or weak.
Incomplete project overview with data acquired but with significant issues in the analysis or preparation, or a lack of justification for key actions.
Project overview is missing or incomplete, data acquisition, analysis, and preparation are not performed

Model Training and Evaluation
Models are trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques, with clear explanations of decisions made. Performance is interpreted accurately with relevant metrics.
Models are trained and evaluated with minor issues or gaps in rationale. Interpretation of performance is generally accurate.
Models are trained and evaluated but with some notable issues or gaps. Interpretation of performance has some inaccuracies or omissions.
Models are trained and evaluated but with significant issues or missing elements. Interpretation of performance is largely lacking or incorrect.
Models are not trained or evaluated

User Interface Integration
User interface is effectively integrated, allowing practical application of the model. The interface is intuitive, user-friendly, and supports the objectives of the model.
User interface is integrated and generally supports the model, but has minor usability issues.
User interface is integrated but has some usability issues or does not fully support the model.
User interface is integrated but has significant usability issues, or does not effectively support the model.
User interface is not integrated

Presentation
Complete, coherent, and professional presentation.
Sufficient presentation but lacks details, preparedness, or clarity.
Substantial lack of clarity, details, or preparedness.
Unprofessional presentation
No presentation submitted
